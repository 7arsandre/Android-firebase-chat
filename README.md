After struggling a long time with implementing firebase to my android chat 
application. I finally made it work. With the power of Firebase database, 
your chat application is powerfull and seamless.

Only add the 'google-services.json' to your app for it to work.

Layout is simple, but alligns the itself to left/right, depending on the 
recipient/sender. The rest of the layout is lame, but that should be an easy 
fix for you. 
for you.

Enjoy!
